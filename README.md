# Search-Engine-Optimization
This is a complete guide to the project I made on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for a website califoodnia.in. The project consists of:

1. Keyword Analysis for the client Website
2. Keyword Analysis from a competitive viewpoint
3. Initial Research Phase and Site Recommendations for Client
4. A complete comparison between the client's and competitor's websites.
5. Final Recommendation of Changes.
6. A kickoff Question Set for the meeting between the client and the organization.

Hope this helps the beginners in SEO like me! 
Do suggest any changes if you can and I will merge it with my project if I feel like adding it.
